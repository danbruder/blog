            I am writing to you regarding the Software Developer position at
            Instinct. I found the post in the Elixir Slack Jobs channel and felt
            the product and position were a good fit for me.
          </p>
          <p className="lh-copy">
            I have production experience in the technologies you are targeting.
            At my former employer, I led the charge in introducing and training
            on React, shipped multiple React/Redux applications, and shipped
            GraphQL applications (experience with both Apollo and Relay). I have
            some experience with Typescript and believe in the benefits of
            strongly typed languages especially on the frontend. I have also
            been using Elixir for the last year and a half, including Absinthe.
            I also have DevOps experience, helping my former employer transition
            to containerized development and deployments.
          </p>
          <p className="lh-copy">
            Your platform and this listing caught my eye because I thoroughly
            enjoy building applications that help businesses increase throughput
            and reduce error.
          </p>
          <p className="lh-copy">
            I look forward to discussing my qualifications further. You can
            reach me at (616)-914-1360 or dan@debassociates.com
