To remove all `node_modules` folders recursively from a directory run:

```bash
find . -name "node_modules" -exec rm -rf '{}' +
```

I have a few top level directories on my machine including

- experiments
- personal
- work

I was able to run this command in the parent directory and reclaim space in all the sub-directories. 

You can adapt this to other project types by changing `node_modules` to the other platforms' dependency/build folder. 

For Rust: 
```bash
find . -name "target" -exec rm -rf '{}' +
```

For Elixir: 
```bash
find . -name "deps" -exec rm -rf '{}' +
```

Now what to do with all this space? ðŸ˜„
