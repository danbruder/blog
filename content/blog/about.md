### I'm an engineering manager working on making [reality capture](https://www.dronedeploy.com/) easy.

I've been working in software for 13 years, 4 of which I've been a manager. Recently I've been working on a web-based platform for drone management and reality capture at [DroneDeploy](https://www.dronedeploy.com/).

Previously, I built a suite of web-based tools that enable efficient progress tracking for the construction industry called [SmartTrack](https://structionsite.com/products/smarttrack/).

 I shared our experience using Elm + Rust at StructionSite on the [Software Unscripted](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cnAHvdCXedoHxG4w9pWOV) podcast last year.

A bit more about me:

- I live with my wife and 3 kids in Greenville, SC
- I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Grand Valley State University in 2011.
- Here are some [books I'm working on](/blog/book).
