## I'm an Software Engineer focused on building.

I have 10 years of professional experience developing software. Most recently, I've been building a suite of web-based tools that enable efficient progress tracking for the construction industry called [SmartTrack](https://structionsite.com/products/smarttrack/). 

A bit more about me: 
- I live with my wife and 3 kids in Grand Rapids, MI.
- I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Grand Valley State University in 2011. 
- I used to help organize the West Michigan Elixir Users Group. 
- Here are some [books I'm working on](/blog/books).
