### I'm an engineering leader [helping builders do their best work](https://structionsite.com/)

I have 12 years of professional experience developing software. Most recently, I've been building a suite of web-based tools that enable efficient progress tracking for the construction industry called [SmartTrack](https://structionsite.com/products/smarttrack/).

I recently appeared on [Software Unscripted](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cnAHvdCXedoHxG4w9pWOV) talking about our experience using Elm + Rust at StructionSite.

A bit more about me:

- I live with my wife and 3 kids in Grand Rapids, MI.
- I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Grand Valley State University in 2011.
- Here are some [books I'm working on](/blog/book).
