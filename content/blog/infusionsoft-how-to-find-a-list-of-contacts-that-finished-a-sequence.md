I recently ran into a situation where I needed to find users who made it to the end of a particular sequence in an email campaign. 

I found this helpful [article with the answer](https://www.infusionsoft.com/business-success-blog/marketing/automation/campaign-reporting-demystified) (see item #2). 

To find users who made it to the end of a sequence: 
1. Go to `Marketing > Reports > Campaign Contacts` 
2. Filter on the sequence you are interested in
3. Select "Queued" and "Done" for status

This will give you a list of everyone who has made it to the end of the sequence. 

**Queued** users are those that made it to the end but didn't progress to another sequence.

**Done** are those that finished and progressed to another sequence. 

Happy CRM'ing!
